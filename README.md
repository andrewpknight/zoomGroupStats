zoomGroupStats provides utilities for processing and analyzing the files that are exported from a recorded Zoom Meeting. This includes analyzing data captured through video cameras and microphones, the text-based chat, and meta-data. You can analyze aspects of the conversation among meeting participants and their emotional expressions throughout the meeting. 

## Installation

This package is a work in progress. For now, you can install it using

``` r
devtools::install_github("andrewpknight/zoomGroupStats")
```

An alternative approach to use while the package is being built is to source the functions directly from my website: 

``` r
source("http://apknight.org/zoomGroupStats.R")
```

## Example

Examples will be posted as the functions are added to the package. For now, again, there is extensive commenting and a tutorial for the functions through my website:
